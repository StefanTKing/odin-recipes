<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Homemade pasta sheets or store-bought lasagna sheets</li>
    <li>500g ground beef or a mix of beef and pork</li>
    <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>800g canned crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
    <li>500ml béchamel sauce</li>
    <li>250g ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>200g mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
    <li>50g parmesan cheese, grated</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Fresh basil leaves (for garnish)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
    <li>In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onions and minced garlic. Sauté until translucent.</li>
    <li>Add the ground beef to the pan and cook until browned. Break apart any large chunks as it cooks.</li>
    <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, and dried basil. Season with salt and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for about 20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
    <li>While the sauce is simmering, prepare the béchamel sauce in another pot. Once done, set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce at the bottom. This will prevent the pasta from sticking.</li>
    <li>Place a layer of pasta sheets over the sauce. If you're using store-bought sheets that require pre-cooking, make sure they're boiled and drained first.</li>
    <li>Spread a portion of ricotta cheese over the pasta, followed by a layer of béchamel sauce.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle a generous amount of grated mozzarella and parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Repeat the layers – meat sauce, pasta sheets, ricotta, béchamel, mozzarella, and parmesan – until all ingredients are used up, finishing with a layer of cheese on top.</li>
    <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>After 25 minutes, remove the foil and continue to bake for another 10-15 minutes or until the top layer is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
    <li>Once baked, remove from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes to set.</li>
    <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves before serving. Enjoy your authentic Italian lasagna!</li>
